description: >-
  Write idiomatic, robust, maintainable Rust. Use this skill whenever you write, review,
  refactor, debug, or explain Rust code: new crates, modules, functions, structs, traits,
  error types, async code, unsafe or FFI code, Cargo.toml, tests, or rustdoc. Trigger on
  any mention of Rust, cargo, crates, .rs files, the borrow checker, lifetimes, traits,
  clippy, or rustfmt, even when the user does not ask for "best practices" or "idiomatic"
  code. Synthesized from the Google Rust Style Guide, the Rust API Guidelines,
  Effective Rust, Rust Design Patterns, and Microsoft's Pragmatic Rust Guidelines.

# Rust best practices

Distilled from five Rust style and design guides, with a digest of each in `references/`.
Where they disagree, this file says which to follow and why.

## 1. Mindset

- **Write Rust-shaped code.** Don't port C++, Java, C#, or Python constructs one-to-one.
  Model errors with `Result`, resources with ownership and `Drop`, polymorphism with
  traits and enums, and nullability with `Option`. Inheritance-flavored tricks (`Deref` to
  a "base" struct, `Manager`/`Factory` types, `throw_if_null` helpers) are smells.
- **Make invalid states unrepresentable.** Push invariants into types: enums instead of
  bool flags and "must be X if Y" comments, newtypes for units and IDs, fallible
  constructors that validate once. Then the compiler enforces what a comment only requests.
- **Application code is not library code.** Library code (anything with external users)
  follows the API-design rules below strictly. Application code should favor simplicity
  and directness: concrete types, `anyhow`-style errors, `Vec` return values, no
  speculative generality.
- **Let the tools do the work.** rustfmt owns formatting, clippy owns idiom checks, the
  compiler owns memory safety. Spend your attention on design.

## 2. Before you hand back code

Run these and fix everything they report:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test
cargo doc --no-deps   # libraries: catches broken doc links and missing docs
```

- Fix a lint rather than silencing it. When a lint is genuinely wrong for one item, use
  `#[expect(clippy::name, reason = "...")]` on the narrowest item. `expect` warns when
  the lint stops firing, so stale suppressions get cleaned up. Use `#[allow]` only in
  generated code or macro output.
- Never put `#![deny(warnings)]` in source: new toolchains add warnings and break the
  build. Enforce warnings-as-errors in CI instead, with `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`.
- Configure lints once in `Cargo.toml` (`[lints]` or `[workspace.lints]`), not with
  scattered crate attributes. If a project has none, suggest `lints/lints.toml` and
  `lints/clippy.toml` from https://github.com/morganlinton/BeautifulRust; the suppression
  lints in it need `rust-version` 1.81 or later.

## 3. Ownership and borrowing

**Prefer unique ownership.** Reach for `Rc`/`Arc` only when shared ownership is part of
the design, and for `RefCell`/`Mutex` only when interior mutability is. They are not
failures, but they move checking from compile time to run time, so use them on purpose.

**Don't clone to make the borrow checker stop complaining.** A clone that exists only to
end a borrow produces a silent copy whose later changes are lost. Try these first, in
roughly this order:

1. Extend a temporary with a named `let`, or shorten a borrow with a block.
2. Split a long expression into typed intermediates so the failing step is visible.
3. Move a field out of `&mut self` with `std::mem::take` (needs `Default`),
   `std::mem::replace`, or `Option::take` instead of cloning it.
4. Split a large struct into smaller ones so disjoint fields can be borrowed separately.
   The compiler tracks disjoint field borrows inside one function, but not across
   method calls.
5. Clone small, immutable data deliberately, and say so in a comment if it's not obvious.
6. Use indices into an owning `Vec`, or `Rc<RefCell<_>>` with `Weak` back-pointers, as
   a last resort. Avoid self-referential structs.

```rust
// Move out of a &mut enum without cloning.
fn a_to_b(e: &mut MyEnum) {
    if let MyEnum::A { name, x: 0 } = e {
        *e = MyEnum::B { name: std::mem::take(name) };
    }
}
```

**Accept the most general borrowed type.** `&str` not `&String`, `&[T]` not `&Vec<T>`,
`&T` not `&Box<T>`, `Option<&T>` not `&Option<T>`. Deref coercion then lets callers pass
owned values, borrows, or literals. Where you only read a path, string, or byte buffer,
`impl AsRef<Path>` / `impl AsRef<str>` / `impl AsRef<[u8]>` is fine on parameters (never
on struct fields; store `PathBuf` and `String`). Library code that only iterates should
take `impl IntoIterator<Item = T>`; application code may simply take `&[T]`.

**Take ownership only when you need it, and then take it by value.** If a function stores
or consumes its argument, take `T`, not `&T` plus an internal `.clone()`. If it only
reads, take `&T`; if it mutates in place, `&mut T`. Return multiple values as a tuple or
struct, not through `&mut` out-parameters (reusing a caller-owned buffer, as
`Read::read` does, is the exception).

**Prefer owned data in structs.** A struct holding `&'a T` forces a lifetime onto every
container. Owning a `String` or `Vec<u8>` is usually simpler and rarely the bottleneck.
When a type does carry a lifetime, give it a descriptive name (`'src`, `'conn`); `'_` and
`'a` are fine on simple functions.

**Freeze after setup.** Build with `let mut`, then rebind `let data = data;` so later
code cannot mutate it by accident.

**Keep `Rc`, `Arc`, `Box`, and `RefCell` out of public signatures.** Take `&T`,
`&mut T`, or `T` and let callers decide how to own things. A service that must be shared
implements a cheap `Clone` by wrapping its state in `Arc<Inner>` internally.

## 4. Types and API design

### Naming

| Item | Case | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Types, traits, enum variants | `UpperCamelCase` | Acronyms are one word: `Uuid`, `HttpClient` |
| Functions, methods, modules, locals | `snake_case` | |
| Constants, statics | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | |
| Type parameters | short, from the main bound | `T`, `R: Read`, `W: Write` |
| Lifetimes | short lowercase | descriptive when on a type |

- No `get_` prefix on getters: `fn len(&self)`, `fn name(&self) -> &str`,
  `fn name_mut(&mut self)`. Use bare `get` only when there is one obvious thing to get
  (`Cell::get`). Related: `set_foo(T)`, `take_foo()`, `with_foo(|f| ..)` for closure
  access, and unsafe `_unchecked` siblings for checked accessors.
- Conversion prefixes signal cost and ownership: `as_` (free, borrow to borrow), `to_`
  (expensive, borrow to owned or borrow to borrow), `into_` (consumes `self`). Put `mut`
  in type order: `as_mut_slice`, not `as_slice_mut`.
- Constructors: `new` (primary), `with_capacity` / `new_with_foo` (variants), `try_new`
  (fallible), `from_foo` (conversion; pair important ones with a `From` impl). I/O
  resources use domain verbs: `File::open`, `TcpStream::connect`.
- `iter` / `iter_mut` / `into_iter` return types named `Iter` / `IterMut` / `IntoIter`;
  `keys()` returns `Keys`.
- Error types read verb-object-error: `ParseBoolError`, not `BoolParseError`.
- Avoid weasel suffixes `Service`, `Manager`, `Factory`, `Helper`, `Util`. Name the thing
  it is (`Bookings`, `Dispatcher`, `FooBuilder`). Don't repeat the module name in the
  type (`foo::Id`, not `foo::FooId`). Avoid abbreviations an outsider wouldn't know.
- If you implement `len()`, implement `is_empty()`.
- Feature names are bare: `std`, `serde`, `alloc`, never `use-std` or `no-std`.

### Model the domain with types

- **Newtypes** for semantic distinctions: `struct Miles(f64)` and `struct Kilometers(f64)`
  cannot be mixed, where a type alias can. Add `#[repr(transparent)]` when layout matters,
  and derive or forward the traits you need (`derive_more` cuts the boilerplate). A
  newtype that encodes an invariant (`Month`) validates in a fallible constructor
  (`TryFrom`, `FromStr`, `try_new`) and never offers an infallible `From` from the raw type.
- **No `bool` parameters in public or shared signatures.** `report(true)` is unreadable at
  the call site and cannot grow a third mode. Use a two-variant enum
  (`Verbosity::Summary`, `Verbosity::Full`) or two methods (`report()`,
  `report_verbose()`): `Widget::new(Size::Small, Shape::Round)`, not
  `Widget::new(true, false)`. The only exception is a private helper whose call sites sit
  a few lines away. When refactoring, an existing `bool` parameter is one of the smells to
  remove, not a detail to preserve.
- **Named fields over tuples**, except single-field newtypes and very local code.
- **`Option` for absence, never sentinels** such as `-1` or `""`. **Data-carrying enums**
  instead of "field X is only meaningful when Y is set".
- **Use the strongest std type:** `PathBuf` / `&Path` for paths, `Duration` for spans,
  `NonZeroU32` internally only (keep plain integers at API boundaries).
- **Independent flags** use the `bitflags` crate; an enum models exactly one choice.

### Derive and implement the standard traits eagerly

Downstream crates cannot add std traits to your types (orphan rule), so you must. Derive
whenever every field supports it: `Debug` (on every public type; hand-write it to redact
secrets), `Clone` (except unique resources and key material), `Copy` (only small
bitwise-copyable types, because the compiler copies silently), `PartialEq` / `Eq`,
`PartialOrd` / `Ord` (never ship `PartialOrd` without `Ord` when a total order exists),
`Hash` (consistent with `Eq`), `Default`. Implement `Display` for anything meant to be
read: error types, string-like wrappers. Add `#[must_use]` to pure functions and to
types, such as errors and lazy values, whose discarding is a bug.

Implement `From` / `TryFrom`, never `Into` / `TryInto` directly (blanket impls give you
those). Prefer `from` / `into` over `as`, which silently allows lossy casts. Implement
`FromStr` rather than an ad-hoc `from_str` method, `FromIterator` and `Extend` on
collections, and `IntoIterator` for both owned and borrowed forms. Implement `Deref` only
on smart pointers and owning collections (`Vec<T>` to `[T]`), never to fake inheritance.
Overload operators only for their mathematical meaning.

Don't put derivable trait bounds on struct definitions: `#[derive(Clone)] struct Good<T>`,
not `struct Bad<T: Clone + Debug>`. Bounds belong on the `impl` blocks that need them.

If you hand-write `Ord`, hand-write `PartialEq`, `PartialOrd`, and `Hash` to agree with it
(compare the same fields, ignore the same fields). A derived `PartialEq` next to a custom
`Ord` breaks the std contract and misbehaves in `BTreeMap` and `sort`/`dedup`. Say in the
docs which fields equality ignores.

### Constructors, builders, defaults

- Provide `new()` even when `Default` exists, and make them agree (one delegates to the
  other). Derive or implement `Default` so callers can write `..Default::default()`;
  bag-of-options structs with public fields should always have it.
- Up to two optional parameters: inherent constructors (`new`, `with_a`, `with_b`).
  Beyond that, or when construction validates or has side effects, add a builder:
  `Foo::builder()` returns `FooBuilder`, setters are named after fields (`timeout(d)`,
  not `set_timeout`) and infallible, and `build() -> Result<Foo, Error>` does all
  validation including cross-field checks. Prefer non-consuming setters
  (`&mut self -> &mut Self`) unless `build` must move a value out.
- A constructor with four or more loose arguments should group them into semantic types:
  `Deposit::new(account, amount)` rather than four `&str` / `u64` parameters.

### Visibility and evolution

- Private by default. Fields stay private unless the struct is passive C-style data.
  Widen to `pub(crate)` or `pub(super)` before `pub`. Making an item more public later is
  non-breaking; the reverse is breaking, and every `pub` item is a promise.
- Mark public enums and public-field structs that cross crate boundaries
  `#[non_exhaustive]` unless the set is a stable ontology. When matching one, list the
  variants you handle and add a wildcard arm.
- Seal traits you don't want implemented downstream, and say so in the docs:

  ```rust
  pub trait TheTrait: private::Sealed { /* ... */ }
  mod private {
      pub trait Sealed {}
      impl Sealed for usize {}
  }
  ```

- Hide implementation iterator types behind `impl Iterator<Item = T>` (internal APIs) or
  a newtype (public APIs you must keep stable).
- Expose each public item at exactly one path. Don't `pub use` a foreign crate's items
  unless you are an umbrella crate. Avoid leaking third-party types into your public API;
  feature-gate `serde` impls behind a feature named `serde`. If a dependency's type must
  appear, re-export it so callers can name the matching version.
- Mark a function `const` only if it will stay `const`. Don't expose `ErrorKind` enums
  or other internals that lock in failure modes you consider private.

### Traits and generics

- Define a trait only for generic programming (`T: Trait`, `impl Trait`, `dyn Trait`) or
  as an extension trait (`FooExt`). Don't use traits merely to organize code. Put
  essential functionality in inherent methods and have trait impls forward to them, so
  callers need no import.
- Prefer, in order: concrete types; generics (`T: Trait`, `impl Trait`); `dyn Trait`,
  ideally wrapped in your own struct (`struct DynStore(Arc<dyn Store>)`). Generics give
  static dispatch and inlining; trait objects give heterogeneous collections and smaller
  binaries. Don't nest generics on service-level types (`Service<Backend>` is fine;
  `Service<Backend<Store>>` is not).
- Decide early whether a trait must be object-safe. Generic methods or `Self` outside the
  receiver break it; exclude such methods with `where Self: Sized`.
- Keep required trait methods minimal and provide defaults for everything derivable from
  them, as `Iterator` does from `next`.
- If a function has a clear receiver, make it a method. A computation with no receiver is
  a free function, not `Database::check(params)`. Associated functions are for
  construction.
- Closures: use the most general bound that works (`FnOnce` if called once, `FnMut` if it
  mutates, else `Fn`) and prefer `Fn*` bounds to bare `fn` pointers. Closure parameters go
  last; don't take more than one.
- Keep parameter order consistent across a crate: call-specific first, ubiquitous
  context (loggers, allocators) last.
- Reach for a macro only when functions, generics, and traits cannot do the job. Prefer
  `macro_rules!` to proc macros, make macro input look like the output it generates, and
  never let a macro change a type's kind or a function's signature.

### Refactoring someone else's code

- Fix every smell the request is about, not just the cheap ones: clones that only
  satisfy the borrow checker, `&String` / `&Vec<T>` parameters, `unwrap` on fallible
  paths, `Rc<RefCell<_>>` in signatures, `get_` getters, `bool` parameters, `+` string
  concatenation, `#![deny(warnings)]`, error types without `Error`, nondeterministic
  `HashMap` iteration in output.
- Keep public behavior identical unless changing it is the point: the same operations,
  the same success and failure semantics, the same output bytes. Turning a panic into an
  `Err` is the change callers want. Dropping an error variant, removing a derive, or
  changing what a constructor takes is not; if a signature must change, show the before
  and after in the change list and say why.
- Preserve quirks you don't understand and flag them, rather than silently "fixing" them.
- When the module has no tests, pin the current behavior with a few before you touch it.

## 5. Errors and panics

Pick the mechanism by contract:

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Absence is normal (`first()`, `checked_add`) | `Option<T>` |
| The caller may need to know what went wrong | `Result<T, E>` |
| A bug or violated invariant inside your code | `panic!` / `assert!` / `expect("why")` |

**Panics are not exceptions.** A panic means "stop now". Never use one to report bad
input, never rely on `catch_unwind` for control flow (it does nothing under
`panic = "abort"` and can leave state inconsistent), and never catch a panic and continue
inside a library. Where a panicking convenience is justified, pair it with a fallible API
(`v[i]` / `v.get(i)`, `new` / `try_new`) and document it under `# Panics`.

**Every intentional panic carries a message with the relevant values:**
`assert!(buf.len() >= HEADER, "buffer too small: {} bytes", buf.len())`,
`expect("config is loaded before workers start")`. Prefer `expect("reason")` to
`unwrap()`. Don't restate the condition as the message.

**Pattern-match instead of check-then-unwrap:** `if let Some(v) = opt { .. }` or
`let Some(v) = opt else { return .. };`, never `if opt.is_some() { opt.unwrap() }`.

**Lock poisoning is fatal:** `.lock().expect("lock poisoned")`. Don't recover with
`into_inner`.

**Library error types** (any `E` in a public `Result`):

- Implement `std::error::Error` (which requires `Debug` + `Display`), be
  `Send + Sync + 'static`, and implement `source()` for wrapped causes. Never use `()`,
  `String`, or `Box<dyn Error>` as a library's public error type.
- `Display` messages are lowercase, concise, and have no trailing punctuation:
  `"invalid header length"`.
- Implement `From<Upstream>` so `?` converts. Use `map_err` only for foreign errors or
  to add context.
- Two sound shapes: an enum with one variant per cause (`thiserror` generates this
  well), or a struct per situation with a private `kind` plus `is_xxx()` and accessor
  methods. Either way, don't make one crate-wide enum that lists every failure mode in
  the crate, and don't expose details callers cannot act on.
- If a fallible function consumes an argument, return it inside the error so the caller
  can retry without cloning (`FromUtf8Error::into_bytes`).
- Never expose `anyhow::Error` in a library's public API.

**Application error handling:** `anyhow` or `eyre` with `.context("opening config")` is
the right tool. Use one app-level error type, not several. `main` may return
`Result<(), anyhow::Error>`.

**Destructors never fail, panic, or block.** Provide `close(self) -> Result<()>` for
fallible teardown and let `Drop` do best-effort cleanup.

**Document failure modes:** `# Errors` for any `Result`, `# Panics` for any reachable
panic, `# Safety` for every `unsafe fn`.

## 6. Everyday idioms

- **Iterators over hand loops** when the pipeline is short and reads top-down:
  `values.iter().filter(..).map(..).collect()`, `.any()`, `.sum()`, `.fold()`. Collect
  fallible steps into `Result<Vec<_>, E>` and apply `?`. Keep an explicit `for` loop when
  the body is large, does several jobs, or needs awkward early returns. Bind a long chain
  to a named variable rather than putting it in a `for` header, and prefer `for x in it`
  to `.for_each(|x| ..)`.
- **`Option` / `Result` combinators** (`map`, `and_then`, `ok_or_else`, `unwrap_or_else`,
  `as_ref`, `as_deref`) when they're clearer than `match`, and `match` when they're not.
- **`format!` / `write!`** with inline args (`format!("{name}: {count}")`) for
  concatenation and substitution, not chained `+` or `str::replace`. `write!` into an
  existing buffer in hot paths.
- **Explicit types where inference obscures intent:** on `.into()`, `.parse()`,
  `.collect()`, and complex iterator results. Prefer `let x: Vec<u32> = ..` to a turbofish.
- **Drop guards for cleanup** that must run on early return or unwind. Bind them to a
  name (`let _guard = ..`), because `let _ = ..` drops immediately.
- **Closures that capture mixed ownership:** rebind in a block, then `move`:

  ```rust
  let job = {
      let cfg = cfg.clone();
      move || run(cfg, data)
  };
  ```

- **Import style:** one `use` per module path (`use foo::bar::{Bar, Baz};`); types and
  traits imported and used unqualified (`Regex`); free functions qualified by their module
  (`mem::take`, `fs::read`). Import a trait inside the function that needs it unless the
  whole file uses it. No globs except `use super::*` in tests, `use Enum::*` in a function
  that matches on it, and a framework's prelude such as `use bevy::prelude::*`.
- **Magic numbers** become named `const`s with a doc comment saying where the value
  comes from and what changing it affects.
- **Logging:** structured events through `tracing` or `log`, not `println!` / `dbg!`,
  except for a CLI's own stdout output.

## 7. Concurrency and async

- Public types, and the futures they return, should be `Send` (and usually `Sync`). Pin
  it with a compile-time check so a refactor can't silently regress it:

  ```rust
  const _: () = {
      const fn assert_send<T: Send>() {}
      assert_send::<MyClient>();
  };
  ```

  Holding an `Rc` or a `RefCell` borrow across an `.await` makes a future `!Send`.
- Prefer message passing (channels) to shared state. When sharing is necessary: keep data
  with linked invariants under one lock, keep lock scopes to a few lines, never call user
  closures while holding a lock, and never return a `MutexGuard` from a public method.
- Write `async fn` rather than `fn -> impl Future`, except in traits or when setup must
  run outside the async block for a hot path.
- Long CPU-bound work inside async must yield (`tokio::task::yield_now().await` every
  tens of microseconds) or move to `spawn_blocking`.
- Library code doesn't spawn raw threads or assume a runtime; take an executor, a spawn
  function, or `impl AsyncRead` / `impl Read` from the caller.

## 8. Unsafe and FFI

- Write `unsafe` only for one of three reasons: a novel abstraction safe code can't
  express, a benchmarked performance need, or FFI and platform calls. Reach for std and
  well-reviewed crates first; they already contain the audited `unsafe`.
- Every `unsafe` block or impl gets a `// SAFETY:` comment stating why the invariants
  hold. Every `unsafe fn` gets a `# Safety` doc section listing what the caller must
  uphold. Enable `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn`.
- Keep `unsafe` in the smallest module that can uphold its invariant and wrap it in a
  safe API; the module boundary is the soundness boundary. A safe function that can cause
  undefined behavior through any sequence of safe calls is unsound, and unsound code is
  never acceptable.
- Mark a function `unsafe` only when misuse can cause undefined behavior, not because it
  is dangerous (`delete_database()` is a safe function).
- No `transmute` to cast enums or dodge lifetimes, and no `unsafe impl Send` to silence
  the compiler.
- Test unsafe code under Miri and with adversarial inputs.
- FFI: `#[repr(C)]` on shared structs, sized integer types, `CString` / `CStr` for
  strings, allocate and free on the same side, wrap C-owned pointers in an RAII type whose
  `Drop` frees them, check for null and return `Result`, and stop panics at the boundary
  with `catch_unwind`. Generate bindings with `bindgen` in a `foo-sys` crate and keep
  business logic in a safe core crate.

## 9. Crates, modules, dependencies

- **Prefer small, single-purpose crates** in a flat `crates/` workspace; never nest a
  crate inside another crate's `src/`. Split when a crate grows a second purpose or a
  subdirectory. Share versions and lints through `[workspace.dependencies]` and
  `[workspace.lints]`.
- **Modules:** name a leaf module after its primary item (`Foo` lives in `foo.rs`).
  Non-leaf modules contain only `mod` declarations and re-exports. Put the essential items
  at the crate root and group the rest by use case (`account`, `network`), not by kind
  (`traits`, `errors`). Don't define a prelude.
- **Re-export individually** (`pub use foo::{A, B};`), never with a glob.
- **Dependencies:** every one costs compile time, binary size, and supply-chain exposure,
  including `build.rs` and proc macros. Use ranges (`"1"`, `"1.4"`), never `"*"` or a
  needless `"="`. Commit `Cargo.lock` for binaries. Audit with `cargo tree --duplicates`,
  `cargo deny`, `cargo udeps`, and `cargo audit`.
- **Features are additive and bare-named:** `std`, `serde`, `alloc`, `test-util`. Never
  `no-std`, `use-serde`, or a feature that removes or changes a public item. Don't
  feature-gate struct fields or trait methods. Put mocks and fakes behind `test-util`.
- **Semver:** breaking changes include removing or renaming public items, adding a
  variant to an enum that isn't `#[non_exhaustive]`, adding a field to a publicly
  constructible struct, adding a trait bound, or making a trait non-object-safe.
  Deprecate in a minor release before removing in a major one. Use the latest stable
  edition for new crates and set an MSRV deliberately.
- Don't run code before `main()` (no `ctor`-style crates). Don't use unstable features
  on a stable toolchain.

## 10. Documentation and comments

- `///` on every public item; `//!` at the top of every public module and the crate root.
  The first sentence is a single line of about fifteen words, because it becomes the
  summary in listings.
- Sections, in this order, as applicable: `# Examples`, `# Errors`, `# Panics`,
  `# Safety`. Examples use `?` with the `fn main` hidden behind `# ` lines, never
  `unwrap()`, because users copy them verbatim. Describe parameters in prose, not a table.
- Document what the signature can't say: preconditions, side effects, ownership
  transfer, complexity, and why. Don't restate the type or the name;
  `/// Removes an element.` on `remove_element` is noise.
- Link items with `` [`Type`] ``. Hide impls users never trigger
  (`From<PrivateError> for PublicError`) with `#[doc(hidden)]`.
- `//` comments explain why, not what: `// SAFETY:`, `// TODO(issue-123):`, non-obvious
  magic values, workarounds with a link. No design journals, "why we chose X" essays, or
  rule-compliance tables in code docs. Document the end state.

## 11. Tests

- Unit tests in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*; .. }` for private internals.
  Integration tests in `tests/` for anything reachable through the public API, and prefer
  that location when either would do. Doc examples are tests too.
- Test observable behavior and properties (monotonic, round-trips, idempotent), not
  restated constants or mirrored branches.
- Write a failing test before fixing a bug. Cover each feature combination and each
  platform-specific path.
- Anything doing I/O, time, randomness, or network must be mockable:
  `new_mocked() -> (Self, MockCtrl)` behind `test-util`, not a `Default` that performs I/O.
- Fuzz parsers of untrusted input with `cargo fuzz`. Benchmark with `criterion` or `divan`
  and `std::hint::black_box`. Run Miri over `unsafe`.
- Assertions get context so failures read well: `assert_eq!(got, want, "input {input:?}")`.

## 12. Performance, in order

Design for usability first and optimize after measuring. When you do: `Vec::with_capacity`
or `collect()` over push loops; reuse caller-owned buffers in hot APIs
(`fn read_into(&mut self, buf: &mut Vec<u8>)`); `Box<[T]>`, `Box<str>`, `Arc<str>` for
long-lived immutable sequences; `shrink_to_fit` on long-lived collections built without a
reservation; a faster hasher (`foldhash`, `FxHash`) only for trusted keys; batch work
instead of per-item locking; applications may set a `#[global_allocator]` such as
`mimalloc`. Derive `Copy` for small plain types and never for large ones.

## 13. Final checklist

Before returning Rust code, confirm:

- `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` are clean.
- No `unwrap()` outside tests and `main`; every `expect`, `assert`, and `panic` has a
  message with the relevant values.
- Public functions take `&str`, `&[T]`, `impl AsRef<_>`, or `impl IntoIterator`, not
  `&String` or `&Vec<T>`.
- Every public type derives `Debug` and the applicable common traits; error types
  implement `Error + Display + Send + Sync + 'static`.
- No `bool` parameters in public signatures; no hand-written `Ord` without matching
  `PartialEq` and `Hash`.
- No `.clone()` whose only job is to satisfy the borrow checker.
- No globs (bar a framework's prelude), no preludes of your own, no leaked third-party types.
- Every `unsafe` block has a `// SAFETY:` comment; every `unsafe fn` has `# Safety` docs.
- Public items have docs with a one-line summary and `# Errors` / `# Panics` where relevant.
- Application code stayed simple; library code followed the API rules.
